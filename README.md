# Best Bucket Web Application
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)

## What is Best Bucket

The app "Best Bucket" is a online platform product comparison from various supermarkets. It seeks the specific product from the different online shops all at once and gives you the best combination list of stores. It also provides up-to-date sales. Notifications about the new product, big sale, etc. The application is being built for the customers to have the experience of shopping cheap and easy. We will use web scrapping to automatically data collection. Large online stores such as Shawpno, Chaldal, Daraz, Prioshop, Pickaboo, Evaly, etc. have their website. Each store claims that they have the best deal. But now the buyer can easily find the best of the best deal in one place. This process simplifies the buying decision of the buyer since they can compare factors such as price deals, shipping costs, and other features.

## Conclusion

Our project is about to compare the product from different website and show the best result based on price, quality and shop review. Our main motto is to show people the best product with the best options. Often people get confused from where what should they buy. By using our site people with make a fine conclusion on their confusion. Another thing is we will keep our site very user friendly. So anyone can use this without facing any hassle. But we donâ€™t have much experience about this. Firstly we will make a smaller one late we will make a public version. We will develop our project and update our works regularly.
